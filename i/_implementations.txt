About The "i" Folder
====================

I abbreviated "implementations" as "i".

Since Potomac Hackers in open to many languages, I'm hoping we will put
together several implementations in several different languages.

Perhaps we will also make the implementations compatible with each other. That
way multiple Players and multiple Judges, even if running different
implementations, can still compete against each other.
