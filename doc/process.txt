== JUDGE_INIT ==

Judge has a list of Players.

== SETUP_GAME ==

The Judge goes through its list of players.
The Judge broadcasts that a game is ready
by sending a message to each Player that says:
"A game is about to start"

The Judge should send these messages in random order,
so that no one Player has an unfair advantage.

The Judge waits until 2 Player respond in the affirmative.

For example:
* Player 1 sends a message indicating "I want to play play".
  Judge acknowledges Player 1, saying "You have a seat at the game".
* Player 2 sends a message indicating "I want to play play".
  Judge acknowledges Player 2, saying "You have a seat at the game".
* Player 3 sends a message indicating "I want to play play".
  Judge tells Player 3 that "There is no more room, try again at the next game".

== START_ROUND ==

The Judge keeps an internal clock that will countdown from 3 seconds.
* Judge tells players "3".
* Judge tells players "2".
* Judge tells players "1".

After the "1" is announced, it now time for each Player to respond.
The Judge waits until 0 seconds remains.
(If a Player responses before "1", that player automatically loses.)

The Judge calculates the result.
If a Player won increment that Player's win count.
If a Player lost increment that Player's loss count.
If a Player tied increment that Player's tie count.

Judge announces the round results:
Depending on the result, the Judge tells each Player:
a. You won because your throw beat your opponent's throw. (normal win)
b. You lost because your opponent's throw beat your throw. (normal loss)
c. You tied because both Players threw the same thing. (normal tie)
d. You won because you threw and your opponent did not. (win by forfeit)
e. You lost because your opponent threw and your did not. (loss by forfeit)
f. You tied because neither you nor your opponent threw. (tie by forfeit)

If neither Player has 3 wins, then go to START_ROUND.
Otherwise, announce the game winner and announce game statistics.
(Remember that a game consists of multiple rounds.)

Since, the game is over, go to SETUP_GAME.
